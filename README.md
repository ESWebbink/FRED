# HOW TO & ONGOING NOTES

## What we've done so far
As of 2020 12 05: 
  - fredr_kids.R grabs each level of categories from the FRED API
  - it builds a tree showing the category hierarchy 
  - but what we really want is where do the damned Series fit into the tree

## Next Steps
As of 2020 12 05 
Remember the word "OBSERVATIONS" fredr_series_observations
- finish editing the loop in fredr_kids_series.R
